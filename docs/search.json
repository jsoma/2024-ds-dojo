The second cell should do all of the rest.\n\nHow old the user is\nIn that time, how many times the user’s heart has beaten.\nIn that time, how many times a blue whale’s heart has beaten.\nIn that time, how many times a rabbit’s heart has beaten. If the answer to rabbit heartbeats is more than a billion, say “XXX billion” instead of the very long raw number\nThere are several ways to calculate and format/display numbers in Python – string addition, f-strings, commas, etc etc etc. Redo one of the above questions above with another technique and briefly explain the pros and cons of each approach.\nWhether they are the same age as you, older or younger\nIf older or younger, how many years difference\nIf they were born in an even or odd year\nHow many prime ministers have been in office since the user was born\nIf someone says they were born in the future, ask them for their year of birth again.

I don’t know, I’m not a biologist - research it!\nBefore you write out a solution as code, write out what you want to do in words (a comment would be good for this). Breaking down the steps as “real” text can do a lot to help you organize your Python code.\nXXX billion will involve either division, rounding, or converting to an integer.\nYou might need to know about…\n\nmultiple comparisons in if\nadding one to variables (incrementing)\nelse/elif\nmodulo (for the even/odd one)\n\nAnything not covered in the tutorial probably exists somewhere on the internet, or through ChatGPT!"
