You’ll need to convert it to an integer before you do anything to it (there might be some tips in the tutorial to help you with that).\nHow fast does a blue whale’s heart beat? I don’t know, I’m not a biologist - research it!\nBefore you write out a solution as code, write out what you want to do in words (a comment would be good for this).

Define a dictionary called movie that works with the following code.\n\nprint(\"My favorite movie is\", movie['title'], \"which was released in\", movie['year'], \"and was directed by\", movie['director'])\n\nOn the lines after that, add keys to the movie dictionary for budget and revenue (you’ll use code like movie[‘budget’] = 1000), and print out the difference between the two.\nIf the movie cost more to make than it made in theaters, print “That was a bad investment”. If the film’s revenue was more than five times the amount it cost to make, print “That was a great investment.” Otherwise print “That was an okay investment.”\nSometimes dictionaries are used to describe the same aspects of many different objects. Make ONE dictionary that describes the population of the boroughs of NYC. Manhattan has 1.6 million residents, Brooklyn has 2.6m, Bronx has 1.4m, Queens has 2.3m and Staten Island has 470,000.

If Brooklyn has 1.4 million people and Staten Island as 470,000, storing their population as 1.4 and 470000 isn’t going to let you compare them accurately!"
