If the answer to rabbit heartbeats is more than a billion, say “XXX billion” instead of the very long raw number\nThere are several ways to calculate and format/display numbers in Python – string addition, f-strings, commas, etc etc etc. Redo one of the above questions above with another technique and briefly explain the pros and cons of each approach.\nWhether they are the same age as you, older or younger\nIf older or younger, how many years difference\nIf they were born in an even or odd year\nHow many prime ministers have been in office since the user was born\nIf someone says they were born in the future, ask them for their year of birth again.

I don’t know, I’m not a biologist - research it!\nBefore you write out a solution as code, write out what you want to do in words (a comment would be good for this).

If the film’s revenue was more than five times the amount it cost to make, print “That was a great investment.” Otherwise print “That was an okay investment.”\nSometimes dictionaries are used to describe the same aspects of many different objects. Make ONE dictionary that describes the population of the boroughs of NYC. Manhattan has 1.6 million residents, Brooklyn has 2.6m, Bronx has 1.4m, Queens has 2.3m and Staten Island has 470,000.
